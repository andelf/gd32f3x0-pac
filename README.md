# gd32f3x0-pac

Peripheral access API for GD32F3x0 chips.
The API is generated using [svd2rust].

[documentation]: https://docs.rs/gd32f3x0-pac/latest/gd32f3x0-pac/

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.gd32f3x0-pac]
version = "0.1.0"
features = ["rt"]
```

The `rt` feature is optional and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.

In your code:

```rust
use gd32f3x0_pac as pac;

let mut peripherals = pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpioa = &peripherals.GPIOA;
gpioa.odr.modify(|_, w| w.odr0().set_bit());
```
